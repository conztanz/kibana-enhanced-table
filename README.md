# Kibana Enhanced Table (Conztanz)

This Kibana visualization plugin is like a Data Table, but with enhanced features like computed columns and filter bar.

## Features

- Add computed columns, based on other columns
  - Support for [expr-eval](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval#expression-syntax) expressions
  - Support for numeric columns (ex: `col[0] * col[1]`)
  - Support for string columns, including HTML (ex: `col[0] > 0 ? 'OK' : 'KO'`)
  - Support for numeric pretty format using [Numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/#format) (ex: `0,0.00`)
  - Support for column alignment (ex: `left`, `right`)
  - Support for template rendering using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/expressions.html) (ex: `<b>{{value}}</b>`)
  - Template can reference other columns using :`{{col.0.value}}`
- Hide some table columns (ex: `0,1` hides columns 0 and 1)
- Add a filter bar (ex: `cat` filter will display only rows that contain "cat")
- Hide export links (ex: when enabled, it will hide "Raw" and "Formatted" export links)
